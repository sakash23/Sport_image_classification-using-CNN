# Sport_image_classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network was applied on 14.1K observations to classify images of twentytwo sports using ReLu and Softmax activations.

The data is collected from Kaggle. link of data: https://www.kaggle.com/rishikeshkonapure/sports-image-dataset

Here in this model we got 72.98% test accuracy and 87% train accuracy with RMSprop optimizer.

Regularisations such as dropouts and data augmentation are used to reduce overfitting.

Whole project is done using Kaggle GPU.
